Testing, Testing. Is this thing on?"
"I must not fear. Fear is the mindkiller. Fear is the little death that brings about total obliteration. 
I will face my fear, I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when my fear is gone, I will 
turn and face fear;s path, and only I will remain." -Bene Geseret

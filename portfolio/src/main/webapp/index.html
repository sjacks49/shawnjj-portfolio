                Heyo! My name is Shawn Jackson! I'm from Denver, Colorado and attend Xavier University of Louisiana. 
                This is my first internship, and I'm excited to see what I can learn! I was orginially a Statistics 
                major, but after taking my first CS course I quickly fell in love with programming. I intend to 
                work in Data Science since it presents a nice blend of Statistics and CS. I have two parents, a 
                sister, and 3 pets (2 dogs and a cat). My favorite book is <b><u>Dune</u></b>, with <b><u>The Name
                of the Wind</u></b> being a distant second. I also enjoy going to the <a href="Beach.html">beach</a>.

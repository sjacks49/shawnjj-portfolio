            This is my mother. She's also a teacher; she teaches at Florida Pitt Waller. She was born in 
            Cleveland, but moved around a lot because my grandfather was in the Air Force. After 
            graduating from Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver) with a degree in Criminal Justice
            helped former inmates readjust to everyday life. She eventually got her teaching license,
            and the rest is history.
